  * MediaExport
    * Fix coding-style/indentation everywhere.
    * Filesystem-based cover art (Implement feeding-part of MediaArtStorageSpec)
      * Preliminary patch exists, though ugly
    * Add configurable filter on "Genre" to decide between Audio and Music for
    * UPnP class
    * check if g_file_enumerator_container can simplify harvester
    * Find a way to handle images properly
      * Will be done automagically by
      * https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=626531

  * Unify ImportResource and HTTPPost.

  * Check in HTTPSeek really needed?

  * Cache response(s). If user fast forwards a stream, one request completes and
    a second will be issued with a new time offset.  It is important to keep the
    latency of starting the new request small.
     → How to handle devices that query a lot of byte ranges in parallel (LG
     blueray player e.g.)

  * Assign priorities to gstreamer threads
    (See gstreamer/tests/examples/streams/stream-status.c)

  * rygel copies config file to user's home dir if not already there.
    * Copy code from UI.

  * UI:
    * Kill preferences UI
      * Move UI components to gnome-user-share (bastien will do this, really?)
      * Remove rygel-preferences (code and UI file).
      * Remove unneeded API from UserConfig.
      * Remove related stuff from this TODO file.

  * MediaItem.add_resource() should take a res (and renamed) rather than
    taking a didl_item and returning a res.

  * Tracker
    * More suitable name for SearchContainer (QueryContainer?)
    * Async creation of containers.
    * Fetch as much metadata from added item as possible.
    * Use tracker:id for IDs.
    * Complete search implementation.
      * Deal with number search expressions.
      * Deal with logical expressions too.

  * Document plugin API.

  * Use methods (with errors) in Player's API to set props.

  * Player's APIs should be async.

  * Make all GIO calls async

  * Replace magic keywords in model description as well.

  * Get rid of 'handle_error' in most places.

  * Unit tests
    * HTTPGetHandler
      * HTTPIdentityHandler
      * HTTPTranscodeHandler
    * UserConfig
      * config file not available

  * MediaProviderSpec/External
    * Fix search: complete prop translation.
    * search: What about multvalued props?
    * Make use of "*" filter.

  * How to hide ContentDirectoryError?

  * mpris
    * use icons for media objects.

  * Playbin
    * configuration options to set gst playbin props?

  * Handle all provided metadata in CreateObject.

  * Put common code in item and container into object (e.g upnp_class)

  * Totem plugin that implements MediaRenderer spec.

  * ScheduledRecording (ScheduledRecording spec, especially section 2.9.2.2.1)
    * Add MediaItem.ChannelID prop.
    * MediaItem.ChannelID prop gets serialized into DIDL.
    * Skeleton ScheduledRecording service implementation
    * RecordSchedule : MediaObject
    * RecordTask : MediaObject
    * Implement ScheduledRecording and RecordingBrowse classes (only allow
      single RecordTask in each RecordSchedule)
    * Make ScheduledRecording and ContentDir derive from a common class
    (Browsable?). Same goes for RecordingBrowse and ContentDirBrowse.

  * Move common code (construction and serializating) to MediaObject.

  * Move the res field and it's manipulation to MediaObject.

  * ScheduledRecording
    * export EPG hierarchy
      * EPG container
      * EPG item

  * Tracker:
    * MetadataValues:
      * Document delegate functions.
    * Do something about total_count param of search (using COUNT?)
    * Missing metadata:
      * Video: resolution info, author, framerate, bitrate etc.
      * Image: album.
    * Use ~/.face as icon if available.
    * Remove redundant "Item" from item class names.
    * share playlists and other categories?

  * Internal res:
    * Provide IP.

  * Provide APIs for D-Bus service-based plugins (external,mpris,tracker).

=== Doubtful / issues ===

  * See if any of sunil mohan's changes are mergable.

  * Generate default rygel.conf from rygel.conf.xml?

  * Use cached props instead of Properties.get*() for cleaner code. issue: How
    to deal with optional properties on MediaServer2?

  * move contents of src dir a level up?

  * Pass a function to HTTPServer and HTTPRequest for item search, rather than
    ContentDir itself?

  * Implement DLNA's time seeking for non-transcoded contents as well.
      * Probably next to impossible since that would need a byte ←→ time
        mapping

  * remove project prefix from file names?

  * use soup_buffer_new_with_owner() to save memory?

  * UTF16 conversion to UTF8.

  * mark the plugins using %h option.

  * listen to hostname changes and re-create plugins that use %h magic.
