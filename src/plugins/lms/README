rygel-lms
=========

A rygel mediaserver plugin that exposes a lightmediascanner database
as a Mediaserver.

Configuration in rygel.conf:

    [LightMediaScanner]
    db-path=/path/to/lightmediascannerd.sqlite3
    title=My Media

* Supports browsing and searching (but in many cases searches will
  still fall back to the inefficient simple_search()).
* UpdateIDs are not yet supported as lightmediascanner seems to have
  not change signal support yet
* No real DLNA CTT testing has been done so far
